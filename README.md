Stranded Island:

You have been stranded on an island.

You must choose one of the two options to navigate through the island and find your way back home and end up surviving.

Stay isolated or go exploring to see if there is anyone else on this strange island

Made using HTML, CSS, and some Bootstrap

Took some inspiration from the mobile game Tinkers Island that I recently played.

Enjoy!
